# integration-testing
Demonstrative project for writing integration tests in Kotlin &amp; Spring &amp; Mockito

1. Start by reading through doc/Quadient-prezentace.pptx
2. checkout 'crTool' branch and inspect resources/classDiagram in main package to make yourself familiar with the solution.
3. Apply principles described in pptx and implement integration tests in CrToolTest class covering the functionality of CR tool app
4. Compare your solution with 'crTool-tested' branch.

Bonus:
   
1. checkout branch 'cr-tool-bonus' with multi-module project setup and inspect resources/classDiagram in both subprojects to make yourself familiar with the solution.
2. Implement integration tests in CrReporterTest class. There is a hidden bug for you to find in this solution.
3. Compare your solution with 'cr-tool-bonus-tested' branch - test pointing to the hidden bug is still failing.
